Quick explanation of the code and app:

First, loads an Airbnb dataset containing listings from European cities

Then, users can filter accommodation by their preferences on the:
- City
- Capacity (number of guests)
- Maximum price
- Type of accommodation

Finally, the app:
- Display a data table of matching listings
- Shows their location on an interactive map
- Plots a bar chart comparing the average prices by city and accommodation type

The objective is to help users to easily identify what place corresponds the most to what their needs.
